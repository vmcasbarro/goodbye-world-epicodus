<h1> Goodbye World </h1>
<h2> A program to say farewell. :/ </h2>

<p>This page is an attempt to say goodbye to everyone on Earth using our various human languages.  We're interested to see how long our list can become.  </p>

<p>We'll start with languages that the Epicodus staff could offer without using Google. </p>

<ul>
  <li> English: Goodbye, world! </li>
  <li> Spanish:  Adios, mundo! </li>
  <li> Italian: Ciao, mundo! </li>
  <li> Pig Latin: oodbye-gay, orld-way! </li>
  <li> test line item </li>
</ul>
